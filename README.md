Requirements:
	redis-py: https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py

Run:
	screen python emdr.py
	
emdr-memcache.py is for archival purposes, as this is the script I originally used before switching to Redis. It will not be updated with tweaks/fixes. There may be a time when I can merge both and the option of switching to either one depending on the client's needs.
